Learning to develop website.
This website is using threejs and mediapipe.

Current Progress
1. Sending pose landmarks data to threejs scene
2. T-Shirt model following center point of shoulder

Objective
1. T-Shirt scaling (by shoulder size, but wired while rotating body)
2. T-Shirt rotation (work in y-axis only)
3. Adding body occlusion (no idea how to aachieve this, maybe require a human 3d model?)
