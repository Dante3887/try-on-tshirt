Learning to develop website.
This website is using threejs and mediapipe.

Current Progress
1. Sending pose landmarks data to threejs scene
2. T-Shirt model following center point of shoulder

Objective
1. T-Shirt scaling (change to sacale by torso size, added scale by init scale factor, so now won't decrease scaling so much) **chatgpt suggest
2. T-Shirt rotation (work in all axis now, but still no sensitive after rotating body) **chatgpt suggest
3. Adding body occlusion (no idea how to aachieve this, maybe require a human 3d model?)
